# Bankdapp

-A decentralized application which runs on Ethereum test network Rinkeby with the help of the Metamask extension.

-This decentralized Application usually contains three functions in it in that two are write functions which are 'WITHDRAW' and 'DEPOSIT' which withdraws and deposits ETHERS and the read function called 'READ' which shows the current balance in account.

-The Front end part is done by using 'ONECLICKDAPP' plugin in this process we get 'APPLICATION BINARY INTERFACE' which is used for interaction between blockchain and web application, we need to mention address at which the smart contract is deployed and also the network name.
